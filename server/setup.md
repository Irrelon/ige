# Required Node.js Modules
The IGE server requires some node modules in order to run. From the ige/server/ folder, run these commands:

	npm install easyimage@0.1.3
	npm install mongodb@1.0.2
	npm install mysql@2.0.0-alpha3
	npm install node-arguments@0.0.1
	npm install socket.io@0.9.8

The versions included in the install commands are the latest versions that have been fully tested with the
engine build to date. Newer versions of the modules *may* work but it is not guaranteed and should you require
support for your project it will be assumed that you are running the recommended module versions.
