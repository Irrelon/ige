# Shape Factory
A little shape simulation. The mining buildings will output resources and
the transporter workers that sit on the roads will pick up the resources
and move them to the next node along their transport path to their target
destination.

This example shows how the IgeRouter `ige.router` can be used to navigate
around a game's screens and levels, as well as networking, NPC task
management and rendering with `IgeSmartTexture` scripts.

> This game's server will run on port 2000 by default.

To run the server, execute the command:

```bash
node ./index.js
```

You can run the client by opening index.html from your IDE's built in webserver
or by hosting it on a webserver locally.
