# Camera Tracking Demo
This demo shows how a camera can be set to track the position and rotation of an entity.
This demo is a client-side only demo. Load the index.html file. The smaller fairy entity should always be in the center
of the screen and oriented so that her head is pointing upwards. Camera tracking in this demo can sometimes be a bit
 "jittery" because there is no tracking smoothing enabled (as frame delta increases, jitter becomes more noticeable).
