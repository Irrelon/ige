Click on the screen to make the player character walk to the clicked point.

Demonstrates how to make an entity tween to the co-ordinates clicked with the mouse in the main viewport. Also shows
viewport camera tracking and smoothing. The camera will follow (track) the player entity with smoothing turned on so
that as the camera follows the entity, it remains a bit behind the current entity position. When the entity stops moving
the camera catches up.
