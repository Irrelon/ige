# Mouse Position
This demo shows how you can map local mouse co-ordinates that are read from an entity to world co-ordinates. The demo
works when you move your mouse over the second rotating fairy (the smaller one). You'll notice the white square entity
will follow your mouse position. You can also see the same effect if you move your mouse over the secondary viewport
and the second fairy.

Mouse panning is also enabled so you can drag the mouse pointer around whilst holding the left mouse button. Try it on
both viewports to see how panning works individually based on the viewport the mouse event occurs in.
