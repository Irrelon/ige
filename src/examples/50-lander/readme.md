# Lander Demo
This demo must be loaded from a web server (local or remote) to work. You cannot load the index.html from the
filesystem.

Demo shows keyboard controls, box2d physics, particle effects, collision filtering, font-sheet rendering, random terrain
generation and triangulation from concave to convex shapes (automatically), and smart textures.
