# Network Stream Demo
This demo shows how to use the network stream system to stream entity updates to connected clients. It is a client /
server demo and requires that the server is running for the client to work.

You can open multiple instances of the client to see the exact same simulation being displayed on all clients. This is
the reason why the network stream is so useful because it automatically handles updating your simulation on connected
clients so that they all see the same thing.
