# IGE Examples
This folder contains examples that utilise some of the functionality of the Isogenic Game Engine (IGE). Each example is coded to help explain how to use a particular feature of the engine and every example is heavily commented.

Some of the examples in this folder will not run unless they are hosted on a web server (local or remote) as they may use XHR or other features of the browser that will not run by double-clicking the index.html from your local hard drive.

Some of the examples use network-based or multiplayer-based systems. These require the IGE server application to be running on a Node.js server in order to function.

Please check individual example folders for any readme.md files. Some examples may require their respective server application to be running in order to work. That information can be found in the individual example readme files.
